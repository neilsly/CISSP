# Thor Teaches CISSP Video's Length
#### Purpose

I noticed that in Thor's sample study guide the length of the videos doesn't always match up to the length of study time.  For example if you watch the domain 1 videos it's more like 4 Hours and 17 minutes instead of just 4 hours (2 - 2 hour long study sessions.).  I wanted the length of the videos so I could better create a study plan for myself that reflects how I study.    So I created this.
